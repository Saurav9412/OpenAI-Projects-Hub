## üìå About the Project

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Chat API locally by leveraging the [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) models. It covers a variety of practical use cases including:

- **Basic Chat Completions:** Running chat queries against a local model.
- **Structured Outputs:** Converting unstructured text into defined data structures using [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).
- **Research Data Extraction:** Extracting structured information from academic research papers.
- **Math Tutoring:** Guiding step-by-step solutions in math problems.
- **UI Generation:** Creating recursive UI data structures (which could be used to generate HTML).
- **Content Moderation:** Classifying content for guideline compliance.
- **Streaming:** Handling live, streaming responses to process outputs incrementally.

This notebook is an excellent resource for those looking to integrate local language models with custom structured outputs in a Python environment.

## üåü Features

- **Local Model Compatibility:** Use Ollama's local models (e.g., `qwen2.5:7b`) with the familiar OpenAI API.
- **Interactive Environment:** Run and test code interactively in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
- **Multiple Use Cases:** Demonstrates structured output extraction, UI generation, moderation, and streaming.
- **Educational Examples:** Learn how to extract data from research papers, solve math problems step-by-step, and more.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** ‚Äì [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) üêç
- **Jupyter Notebook/Colab** ‚Äì To run the notebook interactively.
- **pip** ‚Äì Package installer for Python.
- **Ollama** ‚Äì A local model runner; make sure Ollama is installed and running.
- **Required Python Packages:**  
  - `openai`
  - `colab-xterm`  
  - `pydantic`

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/openai-ollama-compatibility.git
   cd openai-ollama-compatibility
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install openai colab-xterm pydantic
   ```

3. **Pull the Required Ollama Model:**

   The notebook uses the `qwen2.5:7b` model. You can pull it using:

   ```bash
   !ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
   ```

## üíª Usage

This notebook provides a variety of examples demonstrating how to use the Chat API with a local Ollama model. Below are the key sections:

### Basic Chat API Example

- **Setup:** Initialize the OpenAI client pointing to your local Ollama service.
- **Example:** Send a chat message to generate a haiku about recursion in programming.

### Structured Outputs

- **Calendar Event Extraction:**  
  Convert simple messages into a structured calendar event format.

- **Research Paper Extraction:**  
  Extract fields such as title, authors, abstract, and institutes from a research paper text.

- **Math Tutoring:**  
  Solve equations step-by-step by guiding through the chain-of-thought process.

### Generating HTML via Structured Data

- **UI Generation:**  
  Create a recursive UI structure (e.g., a User Profile Form) by mapping user input into structured data.

### Content Moderation

- **Moderation Example:**  
  Classify user inputs to determine if they violate content guidelines (e.g., violence, sexual content).

### Streaming Responses

- **Streaming Handling:**  
  Process model responses as they are generated. Useful for displaying incremental outputs or parsing function call arguments on the fly.

Each of these sections is implemented in the notebook with clear code examples and comments to help you understand the process.
